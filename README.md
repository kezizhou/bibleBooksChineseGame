If you are the administrator account and are able to change computer settings:  
* Search for "Registry Editor" or "regedit" on your computer.  
* Find the Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\.NETFramework\Security\TrustManager\PromptingLevel security settings as shown below.  
* Ensure that "Internet" is set to "Enabled". If it is disabled, double click "Internet" and change the data to be set to "Enabled".

* Note: Changing this setting will still allow you to decide whether or not to install applications from unknown publishers. You will still be warned, but you will be allowed to install if you choose to.  

When these steps have been completed, you should see a window like this on the install:

### Zoom Sharing
To share this application on Zoom and allow another person to control the screen through Remote Control, you will need to install [**this**](https://github.com/joshuatz/right-click-and-drag/releases/download/v0.1.0/right-click-and-drag.exe) application. The Right Click and Drag application was created by another GitHub user, and uses HotKey operations to turn all right clicks into a left click and drag operation. On Zoom, holding down indicates a right click, so this application will simulate a dragging motion on the host application. To use, check the checkbox to enable the application to start. When finished sharing on Zoom, uncheck the enabled box to end use.
